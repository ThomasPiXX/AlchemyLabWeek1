Blockchain Transaction System

The Blockchain Transaction System is a comprehensive JavaScript application that exemplifies the core principles of blockchain technology. This repository houses the complete source code, including both the backend, developed with Express, and the frontend, powered by React. It integrates crucial cryptographic libraries to ensure the utmost security in transaction processing.

Key Features
Secure Transaction Processing: The system employs robust cryptographic techniques to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of every transaction. This includes UTF-8 to byte conversion, Keccak-256 hashing, and the secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography for signature validation.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): To enable seamless communication between the client-side application and the blockchain, the system has implemented CORS. This ensures that requests can be made across different origins, enhancing overall usability.

User Wallet Management: The application provides users with a convenient wallet interface. They can input their private key for authentication, which in turn reveals their corresponding public key and real-time balance. This section serves as the gateway to all blockchain interactions.

Transaction Initiation: Through the Transfer component, users can specify the recipient's public key and the desired amount for the transaction. The system then orchestrates the entire process, from hashing the message to generating the cryptographic signature for validation.

Balance Retrieval: Users can query their account balance by providing their public key. The system responds with the current amount associated with that address, allowing for easy monitoring of funds.
